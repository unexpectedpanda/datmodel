# Overview

The following sections include examples of DAT file structures. They are presented
piecemeal to help ease understanding. For a complete example of a valid DAT file, see
[Complete DAT file example](complete_example.md).

In code samples, `...` is used where data has been omitted for brevity and ease of
understanding. This omitted data might contain required information to validate
successfully against the [schema](schema.md).


The string `...` is not valid JSON and should not be
included in DAT files.

## Global rules

When creating DAT files, keep the following rules in mind:

* DAT files must be valid JSON.

* String values can't have leading or trailing whitespace.
