# Data model 2025

The last meaningful update to the LogiqX XML-based DAT format happened 28 October, 2008.
Instead of modernizing an increasingly creaky standard, changes have been made ad-hoc by
preservation groups and client applications to force new behaviors, resulting in the abuse
of existing structures for unintended purposes, violating the standard, or the provision
of sidecar metadata or services to enrich the DAT files to enable new use cases.

This site proposes a new datafile standard that provides additional structure and
metadata, so that ROM managers can implement extended functionality.
